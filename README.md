This repository contains all of the R code used for the analyses in the following paper: 
Thornton, E., Matthews, D., Patalay, P., & Bannard, C.  Unequal educational outcomes for children with similar early childhood vocabulary but different socio-economic circumstances.

Analyses were conducted at the end of 2022, and R code has been updated to reflect revisions made in response to reviewer comments. 
The data used is the Millennium Cohort Study and can be downloaded from the UK data service.
However, analyses are based on imputed data, which is not available for sharing. The R code used to create the imputed datasets
is included; the original data can be compiled using the compile education data script. 

A note on the Datasets, which contains details on which datasets need to be downloaded from the UK Data Service for these analyses, is also included.
